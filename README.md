## Core Interaction

This course is an introduction to interactive design and
development for the web. Projects will cover planning and
implementation of web-based projects with a focus on
typography, narrative, and experimentation using HTML, CSS,
and some Javascript. The class will consist of exercises and
3 long-term projects that allow students to develop concepts,
ideas, and strategies for web-based projects. Lectures,
readings, and student-led group discussions will reinforce
concepts learned through projects.
